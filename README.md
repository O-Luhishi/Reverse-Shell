# Reverse-Shell
Reverse Shell made in Python 3 

3 Files:

> Server file which will look for any incomming connections made by the Client File - sends data to and from the local machine to the target host

> Client file which will take commands sent over the from the server and output it to a Command Line

> Multi-Server File - Still on going and not complete yet - Similar to the original server file however can have more than one incoming connection. Stores each connection using threads which means can have access to any number of clients with a reverse shell.
